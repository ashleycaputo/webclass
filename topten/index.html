		<h1>Cheerleading</h1>
		<p>Two things we do in cheerleading besides cheering are stunting and tumbling. I really enjoy stunting, especially when we do pyramids. I was flyer for a while sophomore year, and it was fun. However, I prefer to be on the ground because it is not fun if you get dropped.

		<h1>Summer</h1>
		<p>There are three reasons why I like summer. The first is because I get to go on vaction and see my family, the second is because it is warm outside, and the third is because I don't have to go to school.

		<h1>Weekends</h1>
		<p>I like weekends because it is a nice break from school. You get to spend time with your friends, sleep in, and wait until last minute to do your homework. Personally, I wish the weekend was longer.

		<h1>Sleep</h1>
		<p>I am not a morning person. I will usually wake up between 10:30 and 11:00 AM on Saturdays if no one wakes me up. One of the main reasons why I do not like week days is because I have to wake up so early.

		<h1>Skiing</h1>
		<p>I really enjoy skiing with my family. We usually go to Steamboat, Colorado for five days. I think skiing is a fun and easy way to be active.

		<h1>Food</h1>
		<p>I am usually hungry for most of the day and my stomach always growls at the worst time. I like most foods such as Italian food, Mexican food, Japanese food, and fast food. However, I am a very picky eater when it comes to little things. I don't like pasta sauce, certain vegetables, chili, mustard, mayo, meat loaf, and many others.

		<h1>Netflix</h1>
		<p>I enjoy watching Netflix because it is a nice break from school work. However, I rarely get to watch it because my parents are always telling me that they know I have some type of school work that I need to get done.

		<h1>Traveling</h1>
		<p>I like traveling to different places and being able to see different cultures, even though I am not a huge fan of airplanes. Some of the places I have been to include Italy, South Africa, Jamaica, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and The Virgin Islands.

		<h1>Cannolis</h1>
		<p>Cannolis have been one of my favorite desserts since I was little. Whenever my grandfather comes over for holidays he brings cannoli shells and a bag of cream. My cousins and I break off into teams and we have a competition to see who can make the best looking cannolis.

		<h1>Pink</h1>
		<p>If you couldn't tell, pink is my favorite color. It has been my favorite color since I was little. At one point my bedroom was light pink and my bathroom was hot pink.
